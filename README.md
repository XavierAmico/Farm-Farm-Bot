# Farm-Farm-Bot
This was originally made for a single discord server to helpkeep track of pearls in the game known as Bread Winner World. 
I used json files to store the data, and railway to run the service. 
This however, was not easily scalable and thus I switched and refactored everything to work with SQL postgres and the psycopg2 library.
